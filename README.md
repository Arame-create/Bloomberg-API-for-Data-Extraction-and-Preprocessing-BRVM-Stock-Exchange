**My-Projects**

*Three Jupyter Notebook-based platforms integrating statistical analysis, risk measurement, and predictive modeling for financial data.*

**Overview**

This repository contains a suite of interactive Jupyter Notebooks and a Python module designed to:       

Analyze market data from Bloomberg (BBG)             
Perform risk assessment using financial metrics         
Build predictive models using machine learning techniques         

**1- DONNEES SUR BBG-3.ipynb**     
*Financial Data Extraction & Preprocessing using Bloomberg API*        
Loads financial data from Bloomberg.         
Computes returns, volatilities, and risk-adjusted measures.   
Exports structured data to Excel.     

**2- PLATEFORME MESURES STATISTIQUES.ipynb**       
*Statistical Metrics Platform*        
Calculates annualized returns, volatility, Value at Risk (VaR), and Expected Shortfall.   
Implements interactive widgets to allow user-driven analysis.   
Provides data visualization of key statistical metrics.   

**3- PLATEFORME PREDICTIONS-2.ipynb**   
*Price Prediction Platform*     
Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to predict stock prices.     
Implements MinMax Scaling for data preprocessing.     
Provides interactive UI elements for user input and selection.     
Outputs 30-day forecasts and evaluates model accuracy.     

**4- edhec_risk_kit.py**    
*Risk Management Module provided by EDHEC*
